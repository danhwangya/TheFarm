# The Farm: Who Gets Harvested?

## Motivation

It is every Minor League Baseball player's dream to play in the Major League Baseball (MLB). One main reason can be from a significant difference in the salary. [While the minimum salary is $2,150 per month for an AAA player](http://www.sportslawblogger.com/baseball/salary-information/minor-league-salary/), the minimum salary of the MLB [is reported as $507,500](http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Minimum_salary). Plus, MLB players [earn a pension after just 43 days in the Majors](http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-retirement-pension-plans-lockout-2011-1).

By thinking from a player's perceptive, I wanted to know if I can predict a player's chance of making it to the Majors next year given yearly stats.
